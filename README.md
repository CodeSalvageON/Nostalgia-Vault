# Nostalgia-Vault
Well...this is a tough one to make. I'm uploading this to Github because this will be the last year of middle school for me. A lot of these Google Documents were created back in Elementary School, and I am keeping them here for archive. These documents are a monument of friends past and present. To those who have moved away, you have not been forgotten. I hope to God, even after high school and even college has passed, we will still come back as a friend group and remember.
